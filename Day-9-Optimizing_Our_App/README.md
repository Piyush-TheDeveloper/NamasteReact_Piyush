### 1. When and Why do we need `lazy()`?

  `React.lazy` is used to dynamically import a component when it is first rendered, instead of importing at the beginning when the file loads. This is called **Code Splitting/ On-demading loading**. 

  _In our example_ : In `App.js`, Instamart component and about component are lazy loaded, which means only when the user clicks on the navigation button, those components are imported and rendered. This improves the performance of the application. So, lazy is used when that component might not be used by all users, instead of loaded in the beginning, only when the user really needs it, its loaded.

### 2. What is `suspense`?

  `Suspense` component allows us to show some fallback content (such as a loading indicator/ Shimmer component) while weâ€™re waiting for the lazy component to load or the component is not yet rendered. It is similar to `catch` block. If a component suspends, the closest `Suspense` component above the suspending component `catches` it

  ```jsx
import React, { Suspense } from 'react';
const About = React.lazy(() => import('./About'));
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <About />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
  ```

The `fallback` prop accepts any `React elements` that you want to render while waiting for the component to load. You can place the Suspense component anywhere above the lazy component. You can even wrap `multiple lazy components` with a `single` Suspense component.

### 3. Why we got this `error` : _A component suspended while responding to synchronous input. This will cause the UI to be replaced with a loading indicator. To fix, updates that suspend should be wrapped with startTransition_? **How does suspense fix this error**?

  This _error is thrown as Exception by React_ when the promise to dynamically import the `lazy component` is not yet resolved and the Component is expected to render in the meantime. If only the dynamic import is done and there is no `<Suspense />` component then this error is shown. **React** expects a Suspense boundary to be in place for showing a fallback prop until the promise is getting resolved. If showing the shimmer (loading indicator) is not desirable in some situations, then `startTransistion` API can used to show the old UI while new UI is being prepared. **React** do this without having to delete or remove the Suspense component or its props from your code.

### 4. **Advantages** and **Disadvantages** of using this `Code Splitting` pattern?

| **_Advantages_**  | **_Disadvantages_** |
| :---------- | :----------   |
| **Reduces** the page load time by bundling the large code into smaller bundles and loading dynamically only when the component is loaded | Though the initial page load time is reduced, this increases the load time of each component thats loaded dynamically |
| Only the components that the user needs are loaded initially | There will be many http requests as the components are loaded dynamically |
| Can imporve the user experience while loaded by showing suspense fallback/ loading dicator | But, this suspense boundary needs a new chunk of code to be written for showing the shimmer component | 

### 5. When and Why do we need `suspense`?

`Suspense` are useful when the components are `waiting` _(React.lazy components are getting dynamically loaded)_ before rendering. Today, `React Suspense` only supports one use case which is loading components dynamically with `React lazy()`. In the future, it will support other use cases like _data fetching_.
